The rising demand for clean and sustainable energy sources has led to a growing interest in solar 
power as a optimal alternative to traditionally used fossil fuels. Solar energy offers numerous 
advantages, including abundant availability, minimal environmental impact, and long-term cost 
savings. However, the efficiency of solar power systems can be significantly affected by factors 
such as dust accumulation on solar panels. Dust and debris reduce the amount of sunlight reaching 
the photovoltaic cells, thereby decreasing energy output and overall system performance. Manual 
cleaning processes are often employed to remove dust from solar panels, but these methods are 
labour-intensive, time-consuming, and costly. Moreover, in regions with limited access to water or 
where water scarcity is a concern, traditional cleaning methods may not be feasible or 
environmentally sustainable. As a result, there is a growing need for automated solutions to 
optimize the maintenance of solar panel installations and maximize their energy generation 
capacity. 
In response to this challenge, the SolarNova AI project was initiated to develop an innovative 
solution that combines artificial intelligence and Internet of Things technologies to automate the 
detection and cleaning of dust and debris on solar panels. By leveraging computer vision, machine 
learning, and robotics, SolarNova AI aims to enhance the efficiency, reliability, and sustainability 
of solar power systems. The project builds upon recent advancements in AI and IoT to create a 
scalable and adaptable solution that can be deployed across a wide range of solar panel 
installations, from residential rooftops to utility-scale solar farms. By integrating with IoT devices 
such as Raspberry Pi and servo motors, SolarNova AI coordinates the movement of cleaning 
mechanisms to target and remove dust particles effectively. 
Furthermore, SolarNova AI incorporates predictive analytics capabilities to forecast solar radiation 
levels and anticipate optimal cleaning schedules. By analyzing historical weather data and solar 
irradiance patterns, the system can predict when solar panels are likely to accumulate dust and 
schedule cleaning operations accordingly. This proactive approach minimizes energy losses due to 
dirt buildup and maximizes the overall efficiency of solar power generation.
