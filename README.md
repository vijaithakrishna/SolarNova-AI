## üß† How It Works

1. **Image Capture**: A webcam continuously monitors solar panel surfaces.
2. **Preprocessing**: Captured images are resized and normalized (224x224).
3. **Classification**: MobileNet identifies whether the panel is *clean* or *dirty*.
4. **Action Trigger**: If dirt is detected, Raspberry Pi activates a cleaning mechanism (brush/motor).
5. **Continuous Monitoring**: The system runs in real-time, ensuring optimal solar panel performance.
